## ‚öôÔ∏è First-Time Setup

The first time you run the script, it will automatically create a configuration file at `/etc/vps_manager.conf`.

2. Select **1. Configure Script** from the main menu.

3. Enter your Virtualizor Host IP, API Key, and API Password.

Your credentials are now saved, and you can proceed to use the other script features.

## üîß Usage

* **Configure:** Edit your API credentials.

* **Manual Reset:** Immediately run the bandwidth carry-over for all servers or a specific VPS ID. The results of the operation will be displayed on screen.

* **Manage Automation:**

  * Enable a daily or monthly cron job.

  * Disable and remove any existing cron job set by this script.

  * View the current status of the cron job.

  * Manually edit your crontab file using the `nano` editor.

## üìù Logging

The script generates two log files in the `/tmp/` directory for easy debugging and auditing:

* `/tmp/reset_band.log`: A detailed, verbose log of all actions.

* `/tmp/reset_band_changes.log`: A clean audit log that only contains entries for successfully processed servers.
